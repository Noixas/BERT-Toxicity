So instead, they play to the emotion of the crowds and unfortunately the internet's an extremely gullible place. The mentality of most people with a digital footprint is that if they *feel* like there's problems on the horizon, or they just got upset with someone, or if they feel there is a chance their image can be damaged, then they feel they have to strike first by going to the internet and doing an \"exposure\".\n\n\nMoral of the story here, everyone: If you see someone doing an \"exposure\" against someone on the internet, consider the faults but don't consider it fact until there *are* facts. Don't be manipulated by the emotional response. If you are, then you become a tool, used to defame and destroy someone when you don't even know if it's justified. And if you find out that it wasn't? Then you just became a weapon used for social homicide.\n\n\nI know it sounds dramatic, but we're getting to the point where the metaphor is feeling dangerously accurate, and that needs to stop.",

He tried to do damage control with an apology video, but because it was inauthentic, it made him look bad. In Tati's video Bye Sister, she blows things out of proportion regarding James's dating life to make him out as more manipulative than he is because she was rightly hurt by his contract with her competitor. BUT, she probably doesn't know that Jeffree Star is pulling the strings with James's casual boyfriend, Sam. (Her sense of betrayal feels authentic, but I don't think she's working with Jeffree and Sam to out James as a \"predator\" when James is just a gay, thirsty, teenage virgin lol. That wouldn't make sense considering how tight she and James were before Coachella.)\nBut then, Tati doesn't look so innocent because 1) she talks up and links her vitamins in her original video, 2) she has since then taken the video down despite \"standing by her word,\" and 3) she gained the most subs as a result of this whole drama. \nAlso, I'm sure there's some strategy with her husband behind her decisions.\n\nSam is a closeted, curious, yet easily confused waiter who got in over his head by hooking up with James the YouTube celebrity when he wasn't ready to be outed. Sam has a manipulative \"friend\" who's definitely in contact with Jeffree, both of whom were manipulating Sam in order to manipulate James to get attention and followers from James's and Tati's drama.

And who better to orchestrate the whole 'predator' narrative than someone who literally wrote a song about stealing straight boyfriends? http://www.metrolyrics.com/straight-boys-lyrics-jeffree-star.html\n\nIn time, I think James and Tati have a chance at reconciling their friendship, if James gains more maturity and clearer boundaries around his relationships. Though Tati being a maternal figure is kinda weird when James already has what sounds like a supportive mom, but idk.\n\n\nTLDR; Cancel Jeffree Star, whatever that means.

I've been following Tati AND Jeffree Star for YEARS now. I never thought such drama would arise from something they would cause and be partly at fault. Because I'm not denying James is also at fault here as well. THEY ALL ARE. After watching all the videos starting from Tati's initial \"Bye sister\" video, I need to point out that we need to remember the AGE DIFFERENCES HERE. Jeffree and Tati are DECADES OLDER than James. Before Jeffree wrote everything he did he really should've been mature enough to put himself in the shoes of James because Jeffree at JAMES' AGE was not any more mature than James is. We ALL make mistakes at that age and I'm sure our mistakes would be just as bad or worse if we had such a platform with money and fame. So moral of the story is don't judge others because we were all that age once and we have ALL made mistakes. James definitely will mature with time and I'm glad he's learning along the way and accepting his faults but completely dragging him and his family down is NOT the appropriate way or mature way to handle things. I understand the pain Tati went through and I don't blame her. But I need them to be more compassionate towards James so that he has support and better guidance as an adolescent. Not negativity that will bring him to suicidal thoughts. This is not joke. He is HUMAN just like the rest of us.*",

I don't think that's what happened here. All the sexual predator stuff was made up, so, if he had said he let success get to his head and sexually abuse others- that would be both untrue and actually horrible for his reputation.

I think this really is the biggest problem here, just both sides being terrible liars(in a sense of not good liars/sucking at lying: fake crying,massive blinking,the breathing, etc.) and none of them giving us the whole story. \nBUT:\n1. If she cared for James' career she would not go public at this stage (there lies a whole other story there)\n2. As someone who appearently (I honestly never heard of her before mb) is such an iconic figure in the fashion industry with a lot of connections and a big fanbase she had to know the impact it would have for her to do what she did meaning she deliberately destroyed some elses career for the whole petty reasons of \n3. the beauty products, which we all recently learned was not the biggest issue. I see her being hurt but that was just going all ballistics on her mentee. Maybe I'm wrong but either she threw him under the bus or she just failed as a mentor.\nIn conclusion this whole situation is just ridiculous to me and should've never reached public.\nIf James' career should go down I think Tati should not profit of it, but that's just my opinion, which I'm not supposed to give.\nHappy to hear your thoughts.",

The last 2 days have been weird and scary, but it was so calming to have heard through the experience of Pewds because I can agree, there is no perfect moment to first pull out your privates to a Doctor. After 5 of them I can say it gets easier after that first time. Turns out I also have an enlarged vain around Lefty and now have booked a surgery.

            "2 years after I had a penis problem I decided that it isn't going to clear up because before that it seemed to be getting better and I tried to fix it myself and made it worse but I really didn't want to get circumsised so I just tried to fix my foreskin myself. I'm a virgin so having my female docter I had from when I was a baby look st my dick let alone touch it (anxiety attack what if I get hard worse what if she's manipulating it and I go off because I've never been touched before well it was her assistant co-op a girl I've never met I scheduled a physical so we did all that and I almost chickened out and left but, i said what it was i  needed and I dropped my pants and showed them my dick whitch was worse because the office was small so I litterally had to corner myself in the room with both of them blocking the exit and I was having an anxiety attack but neither one of then knew that I kept pretty cool. I also had a blood blister on my penis from accidentally zipping it in my pants and it decided to pop when I dropped my pants so blood over my penis I was handed a tissue to clean it up I explained all why there was blood because the Dr was ready to send me to the hospital. Well long story short she thought circumsise she made an appointment with a urologist and gave me a steroid cream so I used it for 6 months and it was slow progress but it did open up a fair amount well urologist appointment came up and he said it's not going to have to circumsise    you we'll have to schedual my head was swimming my worse fear (i can't explain why I felt this way it's such a small thing but I felt it emotionally and mentally and I honestly felt like breaking down crying) well I made some fake excuse because I thought I have some steroid left I'll use that and try to streach it open slowly over time it was working until I pushed it and it started closing again because I broke the skin I freaked and kind of gave up but now a few weeks ago I looked up my condition and I found out that the steroid is successful over 90% of the time as long as you keep excorsiseing the area which none of the docters told me about I was just rubbing in the cream it did such a great job on its own that I was convinced that if I was doing the excorsiIng with it it would have worked now I have to go in and confront the docter say hey you screwed up let's try again. I mean I'm still currently working through the scraps of what's left of the cream and the skin is literally 4x as open as it was when I started still got some left but in about 3 weeks I'll be out and will have to go to the docter again plus I know using steroids for a long time can cause thinning of the skin which would screw it up forever so I'm thinking I'll go till I'm out and treat my penis like it's made of glass then wait till the new year and get more stuff. But fuck I had to learn this shit from a website and not from the one of the two docters there or the drugstore guy who knew what was going on but didn't want to embarrass me or the friggin urologist who said I could keep using the cream till it was gone but if there wasn't any more improvement he'd snip me.",

At that very moment he screams, \"You broke my balls!\"  I was shocked and embarrassed; looked around and the people's facial reactions didn't help any.  My son then, from both his pocks, pulls out the crushed ping pong balls and screams out, \"See, you broke my balls!\"  Everyone in all lines at the bank, including the teller, broke out in laughter; of course, I did too.  I miss my son so very much, he was funny and left lots of fond memories.

His playthrough of Doki Doki LC was my favorite out of everyone's playthrough. I always thought he was an underrated gamer that deserves the recognition he deserves because of the content he puts out, especially when in my opinion, are better than some other reviewers out there. Now I feel lost and so confused and so heart broken that this happened and I'll never look at his videos the same way. Projared, you really fucked up and fucked all of us up with this.

Husbands, boyfriends, and contenders included.\n#4 If people are having sex without making babies then their bodies will begin telling them somethings wrong, and both will begin seeking out new mates whether they are aware of it or not.\n-This explains (almost) everything except for tribalism.

Either you are going to look for God and follow him or u are not but remember if you choose not to you will die in your sins and wether you like it or not you will be standing in front of God in judgement day and you will be guilty but, if you choose Jesus ur guilt is already paid off in Him. He died for u and me.  Take a moment and think what is this life all about?  Is gonna end eventually.  Is this it?  all of it?  Or do we have a greater purpose to serve a God and this is a test of our faith.  Either you want it or not you are going to die i hope everyone who reads this are certain of there believe because it will define where will you be for eternity and thats a long way to go.

One filled with delight and everyone happy that we had passed the milestone, not congratulating because we have beaten another channel. I'm glad that T-Series will be the first because this means the end of the battle will be calm. The wars will end, the sub counts will go and the channels can go back to being normal channels. Not enemies. Maybe we can now be friends with them. Of course, another battle will pop up with another youtube and another youtuber will try to beat Pewds and maybe this time the approach will be much calmer:No graffiti destroying the world and no murderers mentioning Pewds.

I got bullied in school for not supporting PewDiePie anymore.\nI saw people doing many things related to him but then they just started these stereotypes which came from one of his Diss Tracks. The stereotype was that because T-SERIES are Indians then they will probably lose because Indians suck. Many of these stereotypes came from children of my age and greater than my age. I saw that my school got divided and everyone were hitting each other just because of this meme.\nI appreciate the effort taken by all those people who did so many things, but these things just became harmful for children like me. People will divide each other because of this small little thing. Those Diss Tracks might be fun for those who do not belong to India, but they aren't fun for us Indians.

I even read that some idiot considers this a 'gateway' channel to radicalization 'due to the viewers being 9 yrs old' what a great example of modern media just being shit at their jobs.

I could see him doing that to somebody, but not because he was rude but because he loved his job, I'm sure, and he didn't want to be pushed around and put on a pedestal. It reminds me of what happened with alladin, how he didn't want a second one to be made and no genie toys to be exploited by Disney, and that's why he agreed to be the voice of the genie. Of course they disrespected that, sold the toys, and made a second movie without him. I think he did come back for the third Alladin, but obviously reluctantly.

Also, it's best to ask someone for their autograph or to be in a photo/selfie with them at a convention or venue where it's appropriate -- I think it's rude of us, as fans, to interrupt someone's dinner!  \n\nI used to attend comic conventions as an artist in the industry seeking employment and networking, so I had my own booth -- most of the time I met many famous people in the entertainment industry \"on accident\" at a local bar or during a cigarette break, sometimes even in a restroom!

It's good when keeping certain people from knowing things that could be bad for them to know because they might be bad people, but either way, if they find out they've been censored and kept in the dark, they could fly off the wall anyway. So censorship is pointless if it just leads to the same behavior. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes knowing things you shouldn't keeps you from making those mistakes. Why do you think when you shelter your child they go off the chain in adulthood and do the things they weren't allowed to do before more dramatically than if they were just allowed and taught to be safe.",

There would be no justice if there were no problems. So in order to better see Justice we need to better see the nature of relational problems. \nThere are two basic truths that greatly experienced by every people:\n\n1. Nobody was asked whether or not they wanted to be born, therefore everybody deserves everything in the universe. \n2. The scarcity of the world is not of time nor energy nor money but of mutual solutions. In order to increase the level of availability of mutual solutions, people need to reward those who solve the problems. \nTherefore since everybody deserves everything, relatively nobody would want to reduce the level of availability of mutual solutions.\n\nTherefore a solution would fall in the spectrum of Justice if it doesn't reduce someone's worthiness of everything and doesn't reduce the level of availability of mutual solutions for the long run.  \nThe intensity of its justness would be magnified if the solution further increases the level of availability of mutual solutions and increases one's access to them without reducing the other's current access. \nHowever, people compromise with a lesser form of justice when there were no other solutions. People would accept solutions that are the closest towards that direction (as just), whenever they couldn't come up with true Justice.",

            "You mention that money doesn't necessary correlates to happiness - the more you get at the certain point, it doesn't affect your level of happiness. \nThis is due to the Law of Diminishing Value, which states that the more you have of something, the less you appreciate it. \n\nAn example could apply to eating Mcchickens on a  regular basis. Let's say you haven't had a Mcchicken in awhile and order one. You will appreciate the Mcchicken more in that moment rather then eating a Mcchicken everyday for two weeks or even multiple times throughout the day. The same concept applies to wealth and virtually everything. \n\nMoreover, someone who has been poor or middleclass most of their life that recently came across a great fortune will appreciate the money and be far more happier with it than a rich person who have had it all or most of their life ever will be, but at a certain point when your lifestyle has been accustomed to being rich, you will begin to appreciate it less. \n\nFurthermore, a rich person who grew up with wealth his entire life will not be happier then a poor or middle class person if he were to gain a million.  For the rich man who spends millions all the times and is in most cases making millions every year, this is normal and therefore it means less to him then his poorer counterparts, which means the initial reception of the million and what he can do with it is of less value because he has been spending high volumes of money most his life since he has more then he can spend in most cases to fulfill & maintain his lifestyle, needs, and wants.  His appreciation for the extra increase in wealth will be shorter in duration than a poor or middle class man due to the Law of Diminishing Value, but a rich man will rank almost universally as happier on a more than their poorer counterparts. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the desires in their life and experiences they have are more varied then their poorer counterpart, leading to more fulfillment in life. Granted, the same experiences are still affected by the Law of Diminishing Values. They can still lose their charm if repeated enough times on a consistent basis, but by large, most of their desires are fulfilled and their life is more stable and happier as a result. \n\nMoney is simply influence, along with buying goods and services, it buys life experiences, which do effect ones quality of happiness throughout their life.",

These same boys concluded that the beloved teacher and mentor Socrates had too much charisma and they gave him the classic \"ur banished or u die.\" Everyone was sad Socrates had to leave and many of his students begged to be banished with him and to follow him wherever he went; but to everyones surprise, Socrates took the \"die\" option like a fuckn savage. It's said that he drank the poison vile and called all his students around to teach his final lesson, and that his students frantically took notes with tears in their eyes as they watched him slowly collapse and never finish his final teaching.\n\nPlato my boy, was one of these students!

Plato was an elitist because he came from a rich family, some of his ideas had been formed before Socrates's death.\n2. Sophists were 'philosophers for hire'. They could be teachers or they would be hired to write up speaches for people who had to attend the ancient Greek equivalet of what today is the court (Greeks loved to attend legal battles). Most sophists were great manipulators. Their theory about truth is also interesting, they suggested that there were always at least two opposing truths about everything. \nPersonal opinion: Aristoteles is way more refreshing than Plato, I enjoyed reading his texts.

Of course a lot of Marx's ideas were crazy but philosophy needs to have a radical openness in itself, and it's what we need more of  today with all this censorship too, because of th simple fact that philosophy can't see into the future, it's a constant discussion of ideas.",

In sum, his maths were off and he was asked to hold off publishing his theory until that could get worked out. He said he would, then wert back on his word and published anyway including a couple of digs at the Pope. He was an impatient, arrogant, competitive little man who bit the hand that fed him. He got whacked. Eventually the maths were worked out by others and scientific knowledge was advanced. Problem solved.  Both had missteps, but it wasn't censorship--it was imprudence.",

We were introduced to no new concepts, it was the same thing: find a group, survive with them, watch them fall apart, find the left over group and form a new group and repeat.\nwhats the point of making it back to the school? eventually they're gonna run out of resources since they sucked the place dry from resources, last of them being the ones found in that house where the couple was tied. One of them is gonna die and turn into a walker and all that over and over again just like in walking dead 1 2 and 3.\nwhat this season needed was a resolution, not just more characters and pushing the story forward, it was time to end the story. Maybe the walkers finally died off and normal pre-apocalypse earth restored. Maybe an explanation for all the zombies was found and potentially a cure i mean any kind of conclusive new concept would've done great.\ni'll rephrase my conclusion about this: it was a great season but it didn't feel like an ending.",

Then again, Clem has survived pretty much every type of injury known to man, especially depending on how you end season 2. Nearly drowning, nearly freezing, being mauled by a dog, being shot, being stabbed, burned, multiple car wrecks despite the few cars, potentially losing a finger, hit with the butt of guns, surviving 3 explosions in this season alone.

If the audience affirms that she needs a sequel, Skybound/mudle ought to do just that. Personally, I want to see a scene where they go back in the barn and the future of the school. Obviously a tragedy has to take place, but seeing clementine have a life beyond zombie killing and suffering would be great! After all, The Walking Dead TV show is just that.",

When Clementine got bitten, I thought that the first thing any logical person would do would be to amputate the leg and stop the infection from spreading. It's a simple choice. Either you're guaranteed to \"die\" and turn into a walker, or you cut off the leg and risk dying of blood loss / shock, but you have a chance to survive. It's obvious what choice you should make in that situation, even if they _were_ surrounded by walkers. \nI'm glad that it ended up taking that turn _eventually,_ I'm definitely glad that's how the story ended. But I'm also still a little angry about it, because I REALLY have to suspend my disbelief. When AJ axed Clem's leg off, she had been bitten for what I would assume was at least an hour. Clem's heart would have circulated blood through her body by that point and she would have had the infection in a lot more than just her leg. At that point, it would have been too late to amputate her leg and spare her from the infection. It's just kinda obvious to me. \n\n\nBut I guess that, given the context behind the development of the final season, I should cut them a little bit of slack. The ending could have been worse, I'm just nitpicking about the details at this point.\nA flawed gem of a game.",

To use it, you need to have the destination followed by the particle \u306b, then the verb \u884c\u304f. \n\nTherefore, \"\u685c\u300c\u3055\u304f\u3089\u300d\u30b3\u30f3\uff08\u306b\uff09\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3059\uff01\" means something more like \"I go/will go to Sakuracon!\". \n\n\n\nAlso, come on Felix, you should already know that to say you understand Japanese you have to say \"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u300c\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3054\u300d\u3092\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\", although the more natural way to phrase this in desu/masu form would be \u201d\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u8a71\u305b\u307e\u3059\u300c\u306f\u306a\u305b\u307e\u3059\u300d\u201d, maybe followed by the emphatic particle \u3088. For your reference, \u8a71\u305b\u307e\u3059 is the potential form of\u3000\u8a71\u3057\u307e\u3059, so that sentence literally translates as \"It is possible/I CAN speak Japanese\". \n\n\n\n\"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\" means \"I understand/I will at some indeterminate point not in the past and without explicit intent understand Japanese\". \n\n\n\nLike you said in the book club video with the Japanese haiku poet you liked so much, Japanese has an incredibly vast array of shades of meaning possible to convey. Hell I'm still trying to figure out which of the 200 different synonyms for \"truth\" or \"last\" I should use in various situations that my kanji dictionary gives me. I'm that dude that tells his college sensei \"Frankly, I don't give a single fuck\" when she apologizes for tripping on a backpack and practically slaps my shoulder so she doesn't fall over, when I thought it meant \"I don't mind/you're fine\", despite knowing that \"\u5fc3\u914d\u3057\u306a\u304f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3001\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u3067\u3059\u3088\u306d\u3002\u201d means literally that.",

The review videos (are usually funny but..) are too dependent on if the content you are reviewing is good or not. Although PewNews can be interesting, it's not my favorite format because I don't really care about what other YouTubers are doing or what's happening to them.\n\nYour game videos are still by far the best content.
